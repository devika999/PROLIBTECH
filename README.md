Usually, for choosing an academic project, students need to refer many
journals, websites or they have to visit the college libraries or they have to
contact the previous year students individually in order to get the details
of the previously done projects and find new ideas or topics that can be
implemented within the intended time. These all are very time consuming
and needs a lot of human effort.
ProLibTech is a project management system library where the students in all
departments of the registered colleges can search and download various
projects done by previous year. Students can search projects by keywords,
project title, Year etc. Also the students can upload the details of their
projects into this system.
This project consists of a website and an android application where all
the users can search and view various projects. The users registered by the
college can download all the project details such as project reports, journals,
demo videos etc. Whereas the other users are charged with a small payment,
to access these project details
